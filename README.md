# EdamamFoodSearch

## The Creation 
I created this website to allow people to search up recipes that they wanted to cook at home and didn't have to be overwhelmed by the variety of choices. 
I used [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/) as my API endpoint to search all the recipes.

## Basic Features: 
This site includes the following features: 
+ Carousel 
+ Dropdown Navigation Bar
+ Search Bar
+ API Endpoint 
+ Five display cards

## Installation Instructions: 
To run or edit this program locally: 

1. Open terminal and type the following: 
 ```
$ git clone https://github.com/KelvinWu31/EdamamFoodSearch.git
```
2. Press Enter and your terminal should look something like this: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KelvinWu31/EdamamFoodSearch.git
