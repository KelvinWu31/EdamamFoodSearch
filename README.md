# EdamamFoodSearch

## The Creation 
I created this website to allow people to search up recipes that they wanted to cook at home and didn't have to be overwhelmed by the variety of choices. 
I used [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/) as my API endpoint to search all the recipes.

## Basic Features: 
This site includes the following features: 
+ Carousel 
+ Dropdown Navigation Bar
+ Search Bar
+ API Endpoint 
+ Five display cards

## Installation Instructions:
